## How to Use AI Reports

### Step 1: Create or Load Project
- Create a new project or load existing data
- Select your analysis mode
- Enter your experimental data

### Step 2: Generate AI Report
1. Navigate to the "Data Analysis & Reporting" section
2. Select groups to analyze
3. Scroll down to "AI-Powered Report" section
4. Click "Generate AI Report" (API key is pre-configured)

### Step 3: Review and Download
- The AI report will be displayed in the dashboard
- Download the report as a text file
- Use insights for your research documentation

## AI Report Examples

### Body Weight Analysis
```
AI Analysis Summary:
The experimental groups showed varying degrees of weight loss compared to the control group. 
Group 2 exhibited the most significant weight reduction (-7.0%), suggesting potential 
treatment effects. Statistical analysis indicates these changes may be biologically 
significant and warrant further investigation.
```

### Behavior Analysis
```
AI Analysis Summary:
Abnormal behavior patterns were detected in treatment groups, particularly in 
reflex responses and autonomic functions. The control group maintained normal 
baseline behavior throughout the experiment. Time-series analysis reveals 
progressive behavioral changes in treated animals, indicating potential 
neurotoxic effects requiring careful consideration in experimental design.
```

## Security and Privacy

- **API Key Security**: The Gemini API key is pre-configured and stored securely in the application
- **Data Privacy**: All analysis is performed using Google's secure AI infrastructure
- **No Data Storage**: Your experimental data is not stored on external servers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to configure Gemini AI"**
   - Ensure you have internet connection
   - Check if the API key is still valid
   - Verify your network can access Google AI services

2. **"Error generating AI report"**
   - Check your data format
   - Ensure you have sufficient data for analysis
   - Try regenerating the report

3. **Slow Response Times**
   - AI analysis may take 10-30 seconds depending on data size
   - This is normal for complex analysis

### Support
- Test the AI integration using `test_gemini.py`
- Check Google AI Studio for API key status
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
